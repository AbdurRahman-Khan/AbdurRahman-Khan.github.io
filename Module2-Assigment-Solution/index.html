          Yellow sits between yellow-orange and yellow-green in the color wheel.
          Being the most visible color from a distance, it is often used as a
          cautionary color. The hex code for yellow is #FFFF00.
          <br />
          The color of sunshine and sunflowers, yellow is optimistic, playful,
          and happy. It can also be associated with mental clarity and
          intellect.
          <br />
          Yellow comes in a variety of colors—from sunshine yellow to golden
          yellow—and works well with its complementary color, purple. Bright
          yellow can be used as a pop of color for highlight or accent.

          Red is a rich color with an even richer history. Use of the pigment
          can be traced way back to Ancient Egypt where it was considered both a
          color of vitality and celebration, as well as evil and destruction.
          From here on, red was a staple hue throughout history, used in ancient
          Grecian murals, in Byzantine clothing to signal status and wealth, and
          heavily applied throughout art movements ranging from the Renaissance
          through to modern day art.
          <br />
          Red is considered to be a color of intense emotions, ranging from
          anger, sacrifice, danger, and heat, through to love, passion, and
          sexuality. Its hex code is #FF0000.

          Green is the result of mixing blue and yellow. The many variations of
          green depend on the proportions of the two primary colors. For
          example, more yellow and a tinge of blue could make lime green. The
          green hex code is #00FF00.
          <br />
          Green has two paradoxical meanings—one being nature and the
          environment and the other being money. When it comes to nature, green
          represents renewal and growth. It is also associated with wealth,
          prestige, and greed.
          <br />
          Pure green (equal blue and yellow) teams well with blues, other
          greens, yellows, and neutrals.
